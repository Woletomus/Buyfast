The key to building a high quality CIM is by taking the time to thoroughly answer the buyers presentation questionnaire and providing as much detail about the business as possible.

Looking to add beautiful charts of financials to your CIM?

The graphs aren't automatically created, however, you can access the library of charts if you hit 'Edit Presentation' on the 'Publish Listing' step. 
From there you can drag in a chart from the 'Chart Icon' on the left-hand side:
Alternatively, many of our templated pages have built-in charts that will pre-fill with data you've already entered.
For example, if you hit the 'Plus Icon' (bottom right-hand side) and hit the 'Revenue Breakdown' template and then the 'Auto-generate' button (below) it will fill-in a chart with your Annual Revenue growth automatically. 
You'll need to edit the product + services chart manually, however.
